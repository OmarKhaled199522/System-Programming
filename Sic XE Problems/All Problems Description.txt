a. Set ALPHA equal to the integer portion of BETA / GAMMA.

b. Set ALPHA equal to 4 * BETA + 3 * GAMMA.

c. Clear a 100-byte string to all blanks.

d. SET elements of a 100-word array to 0.

e. Read a string from device F3, calculate its length and store it in register A.

f. Read a two-digit number from device F3, convert this string to a number and stores the number in register A.

g. Write a program that searches for a certain byte in a string, if found, put the address of the byte in register A else, put 0xFFFFFF.

h. Implement the bubble sort to sort characters in a string.

i. Read a string from an input device and print it reversed to an output device.

j. Read a string from an input device and print the string to an output device
after converting it to UPPER case.
(you must use at least two subroutines in this problem. One for converting a letter
to an upper case. Another one for writing one character to an output device)
